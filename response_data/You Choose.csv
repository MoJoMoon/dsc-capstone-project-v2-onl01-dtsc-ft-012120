It is APPALLING to me that using generated actors could ever be considered a positive move for diversity. These ""people"" are not real! By replacing actors with generated ones, you would be taking work away from all of the REAL and highly talented POC-identifying actors that should be employed. 

""Washing over"" existing media that used a non-diverse cast with a generated cast doesn't do ANYTHING to improve representation of persons of color in media. Instead, we must be critical of the creators who made the problematic casting choices in the first place, and work to increase representation of talented and diverse individuals in media moving forward. 

You want people to support diversity through the choice of the media they consume? Then we must CHOOSE to support media that employs real diverse talent.

You want to break down harmful stereotypes in media? Then please see that this technology has a huge and dangerous potential to enforce harmful stereotypes. 

It is a similar problem as with the old Disney animations with racist depictions of Black people. To erase this problematic media is to deny that these issues of racism and representation existed. We have to RECOGNIZE that it happened and say LOUDLY how wrong it was (and is). And we have to be better now that we know better. 

This is the way to effect change and improve representation in media - by supporting REAL PEOPLE - actors and creators - who are telling important stories. Using generated actors is just another opportunity for people to stay in their comfort bubble. Black and other POC are IMPORTANT and we must SEE them. Not generated facsimiles of them. "

But I wouldn’t want to take the responsibility off of the powers that be to implement changes in the casting rooms, production rooms, writers tables etc. Does changing to AI remove them from that responsibility to cast more minority actors, hire more black directors to tell black stories etc.? I would have to understand the concept more because I would prefer more diversity in let’s say, a Disney show with an all white cast but the whole show would have to changed because of the themes and subject matters addressed. Telling more diverse stories is the first step. Another layer is the use of white voices for black cartoon characters. Boondocks is authentic because it was written by a black man, white black story lines (as wild as they were) with black voices. Our people are nuanced and unique. Just putting a friends face on a basic white character wouldn’t do them justice. On a call yesterday, a mom mentioned the movie Jumanji. I didn’t see the second one so I don’t recall all of the details. Apparently a black character from the first movie was portrayed as a white person in the second one. When they got to the game, he said something offensive which the writers portrayed as basically the voice of the original black character. Having that character in AI as a black person would be even more offensive. "

I believe it can have some impact with underrepresented groups being able to see “themselves”.  I also believe it will allow people to self-segregate, isolate themselves, and live in a bubble.  For instance the interracial Cheerios commercial years back forced people uncomfortable with those relationships to deal with it and they couldn’t escape it no matter how much they complained.  Because of that now you have way more commercials with interracial couples, gay couples, etc.  

I believe those media images force desensitization and hopefully those relationships won’t seem like a big deal anymore to the majority of society over time leading to increased acceptance.  I feel that work can be lost if people can control their own narrative.  So now they can “segregate” their own media.  

Also what are the financial implications?  Now you have more diversity in hiring actors which is creating more wealth for minorities.  Will this technology change hiring practices?  Will casting directors only hire certain people if with technology their appearance can be changed?  This could be another way for minority groups to be excluded.  So for instance I could watch a whole Star Wars movie with black characters which would be great from a representation.  However how does that impact John Boyega or whoever the next John Boyega could be?  Even if a studio wants diversity in their imaging they could hire a white actor, pay him a large sum of money, and just change their race with the technology.  As we know wealth is the source of power in our society.

I believe that this technology does have a lot of positives.  Just like with anything there is the power could be used for negative intentions and unintended consequences.  Once technology is out there it is almost impossible to regulate its usage."

This underrepresentation in these different supports also shows a certain aspect of our society that goes beyond movies and media : people of different cultural backgrounds and ethnicities still do not see each other enough as belonging to one single human race. And it is because of pre-existing misconceptions and clichés that we end up being at this point. 
As such, it is not because our society calls itself ""multicultural"" and ""tolerant"" that racism is being erased. The infuriating acts of violence committed against the African-American today  are mostly based on misconceptions and clichés, factors which lead to fear. People have been ingrained with, at the very beginning of their life (mostly because of the way they were raised), wrong perceptions of the other being that is different from them. These wrong perceptions are causing fear, and fear leads inextricably to violence.

I am not so sure though that this system could truly change perceptions of stereotypes : the people who are unconsciously racists or openly racists will have the choice to see who they want to see with this system anyway : their choice would then only be the reflection of who they are and how they think. They would choose to see people from their own ethnicity and wouldn't lean on wanting more diversity. 
However, again, I think it can definitely empower minorities (whether they are minorities due to their gender or ethnicity). 

I think also, on a lighter tone, that no matter the community you are from, seeing yourself as the hero (or the villain !) in a movie or a show could make you feel about yourself the way you want to ; make you feel like you can aspire to reaching the goals you want, and thus have a positive impact on your life and make you take steps for the changes that you feel you need to undertake.

I'd also like to add that there should be a option to self describe race, as African-American/Black (just one example) is very very reductive. The terms are not at all interchangeable, so why are they the same option?"
